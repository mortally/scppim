-- Instruction for running the simulator of self-confirming price 
	prediction in interdependent auctions.
	
1. After you have done 'git clone' the current package from the remote
repository -- manx@manx.eecs.umich.edu:~/repos/scpp_sim.git , You need
to include the package as a new Java project in Eclipse. Once the
package is added as a new project, Eclipse will automatically compile
and place binaries into ./bin directory

2. After the compilation, You can invoke scpp_run.sh from where it is 
located to train a price prediction vector for a particular strategy 
or run a simulation:

For training: ./scpp_run.sh <simul_path> training 
					[<strategy_to_train number_of_agents>]
For production: ./scpp_run.sh <simul_path> production 
					<number_of_samples>

<simul_path> is where 'simulation_spec.yaml' is located, which 
contains necessary parameters that specify a game.

3. The payoff data from simulations will be printed out in the file
'payoff_data' in <simul_path>. The trained price prediction vector
will be placed automatically into pp_data directory.
